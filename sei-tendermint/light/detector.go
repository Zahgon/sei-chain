// detectDivergence is a second wall of defense for the light client.
//
// It takes the target verified header and compares it with the headers of a set of
// witness providers that the light client is connected to. If a conflicting header
// is returned it verifies and examines the conflicting header against the verified
// trace that was produced from the primary. If successful, it produces two sets of evidence
// and sends them to the opposite provider before halting.
//
// If there are no conflicting headers, the light client deems the verified target header
// trusted and saves it to the trusted store.

// and compare it with the header from the primary

// handle errors from the header comparisons as they come in

// at least one header matched

// We have conflicting headers. This could possibly imply an attack on the light client.
// First we need to verify the witness's header using the same skipping verification and then we
// need to find the point that the headers diverge and examine this for any evidence of an attack.
//
// We combine these actions together, verifying the witnesses headers and outputting the trace
// which captures the bifurcation point and if successful provides the information to create valid evidence.

// return information of the attack

// if attempt to generate conflicting headers failed then remove witness

// remove witnesses that have misbehaved

// blacklist removed witnesses

// 1. If we had at least one witness that returned the same header then we
// conclude that we can trust the header

// 2. Else all witnesses have either not responded, don't have the block or sent invalid blocks.

// compareNewLightBlockWithWitness takes the verified light block from the primary and compares it with a

//
// 1: errConflictingHeaders -> there may have been an attack on this light client
// 2: errBadWitness -> the witness has either not responded, doesn't have the header or has given us an invalid one

// no error means we move on to checking the hash of the two headers

// the witness hasn't been helpful in comparing headers, we mark the response and continue
// comparing with the rest of the witnesses

// the witness' head of the blockchain is lower than the height of the primary. This could be one of
// two things:
//    1) The witness is lagging behind
//    2) The primary may be performing a lunatic attack with a height and time in the future

// The light client now asks for the latest header that the witness has

// if the witness caught up and has returned a block of the target height then we can
// break from this switch case and continue to verify the hashes

// witness' last header is below the primary's header. We check the times to see if the blocks
// have conflicting times

// the witness is behind. We wait for a period WAITING = 2 * DRIFT + LAG.
// This should give the witness ample time if it is a participating member
// of consensus to produce a block that has a time that is after the primary's
// block time. If not the witness is too far behind and the light client removes it

// the witness still doesn't have a block at the height of the primary.
// Check if there is a conflicting time

// Following this request response procedure, the witness has been unable to produce a block
// that can somehow conflict with the primary's block. We thus conclude that the witness
// is too far behind and thus we return a no response error.
//
// NOTE: If the clock drift / lag has been miscalibrated it is feasible that the light client has
// drifted too far ahead for any witness to be able provide a comparable block and thus may allow
// for a malicious primary to attack it

// all other errors (i.e. no response, light block not found, invalid block, closed connection or unreliable provider) we mark the
// witness as bad and remove it

// ProposerPriorityHash is not part of the header hash, so we need to check it separately.

// We are suspecting that the primary is faulty, hence we hold the witness as the source of truth

// This may not be valid because the witness itself is at fault. So now we reverse it, examining the
// trace provided by the witness and holding the primary as the source of truth. Note: primary may not
// respond but this is okay as we will halt anyway.

// We now use the primary trace to create evidence against the witness and send it to the primary

// We return the error and don't process anymore witnesses

// examineConflictingHeaderAgainstTrace takes a trace from one provider and a divergent header that
// it has received from another and preforms verifySkipping at the heights of each of the intermediate
// headers in the trace until it reaches the divergentHeader. 1 of 2 things can happen.
//
//  1. The light client verifies a header that is different to the intermediate header in the trace. This
//     is the bifurcation point and the light client can create evidence from it
//  2. The source stops responding, doesn't have the block or sends an invalid header in which case we
//     return the error and remove the witness
//
// CONTRACT:
//  1. Trace can not be empty len(trace) > 0
//  2. The last block in the trace can not be of a lower height than the target block
//     trace[len(trace)-1].Height >= targetBlock.Height

// sanity check that the time of the traceBlock is indeed less than that of the targetBlock. If the trace
// was correctly verified we should expect monotonically increasing time. This means that if the block at
// the end of the trace has a lesser time than the target block then all blocks in the trace should have a
// lesser time

// before sending back the divergent block and trace we need to ensure we have verified
// the final gap between the previouslyVerifiedBlock and the targetBlock

// get the corresponding block from the source to verify and match up against the traceBlock

// The first block in the trace MUST be the same to the light block that the source produces
// else we cannot continue with verification.

// we check that the source provider can verify a block at the same height of the
// intermediate height

// check if the headers verified by the source has diverged from the trace

// Bifurcation point found!
