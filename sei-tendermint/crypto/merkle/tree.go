// HashFromByteSliceIterative is an iterative alternative to
// HashFromByteSlice motivated by potential performance improvements.
// (#2611) had suggested that an iterative version of
// HashFromByteSlice would be faster, presumably because
// we can envision some overhead accumulating from stack
// frames and function calls. Additionally, a recursive algorithm risks
// hitting the stack limit and causing a stack overflow should the tree
// be too large.
//
// Provided here is an iterative alternative, a test to assert
// correctness and a benchmark. On the performance side, there appears to
// be no overall difference:
//
// BenchmarkHashAlternatives/recursive-4                20000 77677 ns/op
// BenchmarkHashAlternatives/iterative-4                20000 76802 ns/op
//
// On the surface it might seem that the additional overhead is due to
// the different allocation patterns of the implementations. The recursive
// version uses a single [][]byte slices which it then re-slices at each level of the tree.
// The iterative version reproduces [][]byte once within the function and
// then rewrites sub-slices of that array at each level of the tree.
//
// Experimenting by modifying the code to simply calculate the
// hash and not store the result show little to no difference in performance.
//
// These preliminary results suggest:
//
//  1. The performance of the HashFromByteSlice is pretty good
//  2. Go has low overhead for recursive functions
//  3. The performance of the HashFromByteSlice routine is dominated
//     by the actual hashing of data
//
// Although this work is in no way exhaustive, point #3 suggests that
// optimization of this routine would need to take an alternative
// approach to make significant improvements on the current performance.
//
// Finally, considering that the recursive implementation is easier to
// read, it might not be worthwhile to switch to a less intuitive
// implementation for so little benefit.
